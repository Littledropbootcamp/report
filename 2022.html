  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Little Drop Education Coding and Non-Coding Bootcamp (LD) is an online-based not-for-profit charity. Under their auspices, mentees with little or no coding knowledge are trained to develop coding skills in the following learning pathways: Business Intelligence, Data Analysis, Data Science, Mobile App Development and Web Development. In the same way, the mentees also vie for success with their participation in the newly introduced non-coding pathways of Employability skills, Digital marketing, Social media management and Product Management. Adequate resources, guidance, and mentorship are constantly being provided for the coding and non-coding learning pathways at LD. We use free learning resources from https://www.freecodecamp.org/ and the financial aid programme of Coursera.
    Aim:
    · To help jobless youth, increase female participation and empower them to develop employability skills, and build a solid foundation in a chosen career path in IT.
    Objectives:
    · To curtail the unemployment rate by providing opportunities to highly dedicated learners to access virtual skills for job opportunities.
    · To ease the affairs of individuals who cannot afford expensive Bootcamps by providing a conducive atmosphere to build their employability skills to reach their IT goals.
    We started this year by onboarding the mentees that registered for the coding bootcamp late last year, where we have a total of xxx with xxx percentage males and xxx percentage females. 
    Of these mentees, % dropped out due to their inability to complete the prerequisite courses to move to phase 2 while y% are currently in the bootcamp, and we received feedback from 2 among them that they got employed while still in the bootcamp. When we reached out to the evicted mentees, we discovered that. 
    To increase our productivity and help our mentees succeed in their chosen career path, we employed two of our ex-mentees as program coordinating interns to monitor and control the activities of the bootcamp. After completing their training with the admin team, they took over the responsibility of inducting the new intakes. This led to the invention of an identity number for every mentee in the bootcamp. Also, the interns were saddled with the responsibilities of organising webinars which they successfully held 5 webinars and a career clinic to sharpen the skills of our mentees and increase their chances of getting employed. 
    They also didn't leave the social media pages unattended as they curated educational content such as learning series, reminscensing on some coding terms, among others, for the consumption of the masses.
    To Keep up with our aim and objectives at little drop bootcamp, we launched our non-coding Pathway in April, and till now,  we have taken 2 cohorts with x% mentees
    Moving forward, the admission process of June cohort which is the second cohort of the non-coding learning pathway, which publicity ran throughout May 2022, took place on the 25th. Thirty individuals applied to study Digital Marketing while 14 people applied for Project Management; Social Media Management has 14 Mentees to be trained for it, while Employability Skills gets 13 participants making a total of 71 Mentees in all. The above translates to 42%, 19%, 19% and 18%, respectively, for the courses mentioned above.

    Likewise, we have 36.5% of the applicants interested in Data Analysis, 30% in Web Development, 11.8% in Data science, 11.2%  in Mobile Development and 10.6% in Business intelligence.

    Presently, we have xxx of our past and current mentees currently employed as x, y, z in various sectors of the economy.
    EXPLOITS
    Undeterred by the unusual increase in the population of interns, we have successfully recorded three cohorts of mentees, with the fourth currently being attended to for June. These four would be recorded in two between the coding and non-coding pathways. It was, however, not mistaken that the rise in intakes was partly due, especially from February, when the non-coding pathways officially commenced with the opening of its registration link to the public. A total of 503  and 420 mentees were recorded, respectively, for the two pathways. Ultimately, we extended our tentacles to more youths in Nigeria and the diaspora. In addition, mentees were equally recorded as participants from every country's geo-political zones. 
    
    
    Though the Bootcamp had been successfully registered as a not-for-profit further education college - the City Open College Foundation - with the Corporate Affairs Commission of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, a total sum of N5,000,000.00 (i.e., $12,174.53) needed to be raised for its accreditation diploma courses is yet to be realised. In terms of benefits, that would also increase the number of courses we offer, expand our services, and initiate the college's accreditation process with the National Board for Technical Education in Nigeria.

    On a part-time basis, we called in two extra assistant program administrators from our graduates. This gesture from the management is mutually beneficial to the institution, the graduates and the mentees. To the institution and mentees, these more hands help improve the service quality provided to mentees in the Bootcamp. To the graduates, it serves them as an opportunity to provide training and employment opportunities. Some of our graduated mentees and those still in the Bootcamp work in the software industry. Two of such gained employment in February of this year. 
    
    During the eighth cohort for the coding pathway, we introduced Business Intelligence and Data Analysis courses to prepare the mentees for new employment opportunities in areas that are both tech-savvy and data-induced.
    
    The full implementation of the LD IDN means identifying and registering Mentees has also commenced aiding not only in the easy identification of applicants but also for documentation merits such as planning and recording purposes.
    
    Under our webinar series themed "Acing Your Steps in Today’s World of ICT," we organised and executed four different events to cater to our mentees’ technical needs and that of the public. You can click at https://ldbootcamp.com.ng/ to have the details on those events.
    
    
    Following the directions from the management, the admin team of the LD Bootcamp are currently working assiduously to achieve the mandate on the building and hosting of a new website for the institution. 
    
    As an addition in this way, the Bootcamp is equally and currently arranging a Career Clinic. Several already contacted Career Doctors from the coding and non-coding pathways of our online training would engage the mentees one-on-one. They would get themselves familiarised with the mentees, share the industry ethos and ethics with them and also advise them on how to start reaping financially and remarkably from the little they have garnered of their ICT knowledge. 
    SETBACKS
    Kickbacks are frowned at because they tend to take undue advantage of their victims. This is unlike setbacks; they are strengths for every keen planner that takes every opportunity as a means to attain success. Such are the cases of the setbacks identified to have posed one challenge or the other before the intended executables at LD.
    
    The unemployability and studentship of most of our mentees impinged significantly and negatively on their goals. Those unemployed and, as a result, met with financial challenges find it hard to recharge or subscribe data-wisely and optimally for their virtual learning. In the same way, the challenge of attending to schoolwork for some of the mentees currently in school caused them a distraction from focusing adequately on their training.
