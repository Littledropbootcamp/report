    <h1 class="introduction">Little Drop (LD) Coding e-Bootcamp </h1>
      <p class="bi-annual">Biannual Report 2022</p> 
    <h2>EXPLOITS</h2>
    <p class="intro-text">Undeterred by the unusual increase in the population of interns, we have successfully recorded four cohorts of mentees, with the fifth currently being attended to for July. These four would be recorded in two between the coding and non-coding pathways. It was, however, not mistaken that the rise in intakes was partly due, especially from March when the non-coding pathways officially commenced with the opening of its registration link to the public. A total of 316  and 198 mentees were recorded, respectively, for the two pathways; Coding and noncoding.
    Ultimately, we extended our tentacles to more youths in Nigeria and the diaspora.

      <div id="total"></div>
      <!--<div id="container">Resident of the Coders</div>-->
      <p class="intro-text">In addition, mentees were equally recorded as participants from every country's geo-political zones.</p>
      <div id="resident"></div>
      <div id="resident-noncoding"></div>
      <p>Also, we recorded 68% males, and 32% females with 27% employed, 36% unemployed, and 37% are students among mentees on the coding pathway. On the otherhand, we recorded 66% males, and 34% females with 43% employed, 30% unemployed, and 27% are students in the non-coding pathway
      </p>
      <div id="gender"></div>
      <br>
      <div id="container"></div>
      <br>

      <p>To increase our productivity and help our mentees succeed in their chosen career path, we employed two of our ex-mentees as program coordinating interns to monitor and control the activities of the bootcamp. This gesture from the management is mutually beneficial to the institution, the graduates and the mentees. To the institution and mentees, these more hands help improve the service quality provided to mentees in the Bootcamp. To the graduates, it serves as an opportunity to provide training and employment opportunities. 
        After the successful completion of their training with the admin team, they took over the responsibility of inducting the new intakes, which led to the full implementation of the LD IDN means identifying and registering Mentees has also commenced aiding not only in the easy identification of applicants but also for documentation merits such as planning and recording purposes.
         Also, the interns were saddled with the responsibilities of organising webinars. They successfully held five webinars and a career clinic in which several Career Doctors were contacted to engage our mentees in the coding and non-coding pathways. They got themselves familiarised with the mentees, shared the industry ethos and ethics with them and also advised them on how to start reaping financially and remarkably from the little they have garnered of their ICT knowledge.  
        They also didn't leave the social media pages unattended as they curated educational content such as learning series, reviewing some coding terms, among others, for the consumption of the masses.
        Also, we created a talent acquisition department for the bootcamp, which is in charge of getting mentees employment opportunities and introducing the mentees to the industries in several sectors of the economy.
        In a recent survey, we discovered that some of our graduated mentees and those still in the Bootcamp work in the software industry. Three of such gained employment through the bootcamp in February of this year.
