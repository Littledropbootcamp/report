    <p>The year 2022 has been an amazing one for us, as we went from three courses in January (cohort 7), where 55
      registered for Data Science, 30 for Mobile App Development and 59 for Web Development, with a total of 144
      registered mentees, to the introduction of Non-coding courses in February (Non-coding cohort 1). After the
      onboarding exercise in March, we had a total of 127 mentees for Digital Marketing, Employability Skills, Social
      Media Management and Project Management.
      Our aim for expansion is to allow mentees interested in little coding to have diverse courses to choose from. With
      this new development, we expanded our admin team by employing 2 interns through an interview. Also, the need arose
      for our team to go on leave. So, we employed one more intern to keep the Bootcamp running.
      After the one-month duration of learning and extension, mentees who met up with the deadline were moved to the
      next phase (phase 2), while those who didnâ€™t were evicted from the Bootcamp to ensure discipline and discourage a
      lackadaisical attitude.
      In April, we welcomed our cohort 8 mentees for Coding with an introduction to Data Analysis and Business
      Intelligence. A total of 172 registered: 18 for Business Intelligence, 62 for Data Analysis, 20 for Data Science,
      19 for Mobile App Development and 51 for Web Development.
      Our reach expanded as we had mentees from all over Nigeria and other countries like Ghana, Kenya, Malaysia, South
      Africa, the UK, the USA, and NjanemaChad), Morocco. <i>(see analysis below)</i>.</p>

    <section>
      <p>
        In June, we onboarded 71 mentees for our 2nd cohort of Non-coding courses: 30 for Digital Marketing, 13 for
        Employability Skills, 14 for Social Media Management and 14 for Project Management.
        In July, we onboarded our 9th cohort for Coding courses with 131 registered mentees, and due to popular demand,
        we opened the second batch registration for this cohort; 45 mentees registered leading up to 171: 18 for
        Business intelligence, 54 for Data Analysis, 21 for Data Science, 20 for Mobile App Development and 57 for Web
        Development.
        In October 2022, the Management streamlined the Bootcamp courses to 5; 3 for the coding pathway and 2 for the
        Non-coding pathway (see why-pg-3). The Bootcamp onboarded its 10th cohort mentees using this new development, a
        total of 204 registered for the 5 courses from Batch A, and 21 from Batch B; 91 for Data Analysis with Business
        Intelligence, 27 for Data Science, 18 for Employability Skills, 25 for Social Media management and 62 for Web
        Development.
        From January 2022 to October 2022, we have recorded 913 registered mentees, compared to 503 registered in 2021,
        out of which 301 are females, and 612 are males<a href="#chart_div">(see figure 2 for analysis)</a>. With the
        increase in female participation, we hope to see more going forward. So far, 673 mentees registered for Coding
        courses, and 240 registered for Non-coding courses (see figure 3 for analysis).
        Among the registered mentees for 2022, 267 were employed, 299 were unemployed, and 347 were students (see figure
        4 for analysis).
        With the changes and improvement in orientation and proper mentorship, we observed that more students
        transitioned into tech careers, even from the undergraduate level. This will give them an edge over others yet
        to tap into these great opportunities.
        A total of 233 mentees have registered so far for the Web Development course, 117 for Data Analysis, 127 for
        Data Science, 69 for Mobile App Development, 36 for Business Intelligence, 69 for Social Media Management, 54
        for Employability Skills, 48 for Project Management, 72 for Digital Marketing and 88 for Data analysis with
        Business Intelligence. (see fig. 5 for analysis).
        Interestingly, the Association of University Union (ASUU) embarked on a long strike this year, and it aided our
        mentees' learning progress. However, quite a number of them were unable to complete their courses and meet up
        with the deadline due to busy schedules, internet facilities, PC, etc. Also, when the ASUU strike was suspended,
        some of our mentees were unable to continue learning smoothly, and some stopped completely, as lectures and exam
        time -tables were fixed. We also had mentees who had to report to their NYSC camp, preventing them from
        completing their courses. Thus, we recorded a total of 161 mentees in the Bootcamp, with 746 mentees evicted; 6
        mentees completed and received their Little Drop Certificate. (see figure. 6 for analysis)

      <h2>Why We Introduced Non-Coding Courses</h2>
      <p>Non-coding courses are great for introducing people to the basics of technology without having to code. They
        provide an opportunity for people to learn about different concepts and skills that can help them in their
        future studies and career paths. Non-coding courses also allow individuals to explore their interests and
        understand how technology works.
        We onboarded three cohorts for Non-coding Courses: Digital Marketing, Employability Skills, Project Management,
        and Social Media Management with Employability skills and Social Media Management.
      </p>

      <h2>Why We Reduced Our Courses</h2>
      <p>The management felt the need to streamline the Bootcamp courses with more focus on relevant and job market
        courses; so they reduced the total courses to 5: Data Analysis with Business Intelligence, Data Science,
        Employability Skills, Social Media Management and Web Development. The Bootcamp admission period was also
        streamlined to twice a year for proper monitoring of mentees' activities. Our admin team has been working
        effortlessly to ensure the Bootcamp webinar is held; we were also able to charge them with responsibilities
        based on their coding skills. Thus, they built a website for the Bootcamp. Do check it out
        https://ldbootcamp.com.ng/.
        We were very proud of their achievement. Also, two members of our admin team got employed by an IT company.
        Afterwards, we brought in another set of interns to boost their personal growth and skills.

      </p>
      <h2>Where We Are Now</h2>
      <p>During the year, we got information from 5 of our Ex-mentees and 1 of our current mentees about their
        employment status. A total of 5 reached out to us from tech companies like Deloitte, Stack Junior, and
        Ingressive. We joyfully celebrated them on our social media pages, LinkedIn and Twitter.
        So far, we have successfully conducted 5 webinars from January to December, with amazing topics such as Getting
        Your CV Right, Upskilling and Ace that Internship, amongst others. We also held a career clinic for our mentees
        in the Bootcamp; we invited experts in their fields to have a one-on-one career conversation with them. You can
        see all these activities on our blog- https://blog.ldbootcamp.com.ng
      </p>













      <h2>Our Plans Ahead of 2023</h2>
      <p>In December 2022, the Little Drop management team introduced a new course titled Salesforce, and the cohort
        will be onboarded by January 2023;
        Sales Force refers to the customer relationship management (CRM) system that helps businesses of all sizes
        manage and automate the sales process. The Salesforce ecosystem is where a business's sales and marketing teams
        collaborate to monitor leads and drive sales.
        This course will change many narratives, as it is envisaged to be the next focus in Nigeria and the world. Thus,
        our reason for tapping into this opportunity is to help our applicants and make them more relevant in the job
        market.
        We hope to come up with programs that will boost our visibility, such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Coding challenges</li>
        <li>More insightful webinars</li>
        <li>More engaging content</li>
        <li>Building a community</li>
      </ul>
